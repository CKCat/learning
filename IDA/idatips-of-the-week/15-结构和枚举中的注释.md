Last week we’ve discussed [various kinds of comments](https://hex-rays.com/blog/igor-tip-of-the-week-14-comments-in-ida/) in IDA’s disassembly and pseudocode views.  
上周我们讨论了 IDA 反汇编和伪代码视图中的各种注释。

In fact, the comments are also available for Structures and Enums. You can add them both for the struct/enum as a whole and for individual members. Similar to the disassembly, regular and repeatable comments are supported.  
事实上，注释也可用于结构和枚举。您既可以为整个结构/枚举添加注释，也可以为单个成员添加注释。与反汇编类似，支持常规注释和可重复注释。

Repeatable comments are duplicated in the listing when the enum or structure member is used.  
当使用枚举或结构成员时，可重复注释会在列表中重复。

One interesting use of this is for C++ class vtables (or any struct with pointers): if you add the comment with the method’s address in the vtable structure, it will be printed in disassembly and you can double-click it to jump to the implementation or hover over it to see a hint window with disassembly.  
C++ 类 vtables（或任何带有指针的结构）的一个有趣用法是：如果在 vtable 结构中添加带有方法地址的注释，就会在反汇编中打印出来，你可以双击该注释跳转到实现，或将鼠标悬停在该注释上查看带有反汇编的提示窗口。
